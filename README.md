### Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop: The primary tool for data visualization and dashboard development. It was used for importing, cleaning, modeling, and visualizing the Global Superstore dataset.

- Power Query: Utilized for data transformation tasks such as filtering, merging, removing duplicates, creating custom columns, and applying conditional logic before loading data into the model.

- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used extensively to create custom measures and calculated columns for KPIs like profit margin, average discount, ranking by profit, and filtering based on business rules (e.g., cities with more than 10 orders).

- Power BI Visualizations: A mix of bar charts, tables, filled maps, KPI cards, and matrix were used to create a visually engaging report. Conditional formatting and tooltips were used to enhance interactivity.

- Slicers and Filters: Dynamic slicers were added to allow users to explore data by region, country, and city. These slicers were also configured to isolate analysis in specific questions.

- GitHub: Used for project documentation.
